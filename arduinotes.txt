EEPROM - electrically erasable programmable read-only memory
	-but not really read-only, can write to it

RX<-0 = receive
TX->1 = transmit

quartz crystal oscillator - ticks 16 million times/second, one mathematical operation each tick

Ohm's Law
	I = V/R
		current = voltage/resistance
			A = V/â„¦
				amperes = voltage/ohms
	mA = .001 amperes (1/1000)

P = I*V
	watts = amps*voltage
P = (V^2)/R
	watts = volts^2/resistance


For Uno: interrupt 0 is D2, 1 is D3 - the only 2 interrupts allowed
For Due: All pins can be interrupts
